# LAMBDA - AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service.

You organize your code into Lambda functions. Lambda runs your function only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time that you consumeâ€”there is no charge when your code is not running.

When using Lambda, you are responsible only for your code. Lambda manages the compute fleet that offers a balance of memory, CPU, network, and other resources to run your code. Because Lambda manages these resources, you cannot log in to compute instances or customize the operating system on provided runtimes. Lambda performs operational and administrative activities on your behalf, including managing capacity, monitoring, and logging your Lambda functions.

## Features

- Concurrency and scaling controls

  Concurrency and scaling controls such as concurrency limits and provisioned concurrency give you fine-grained control over the scaling and responsiveness of your production applications.

- Functions defined as container images

  Use your preferred container image tooling, workflows, and dependencies to build, test, and deploy your Lambda functions.

- Code signing

  Code signing for Lambda provides trust and integrity controls that let you verify that only unaltered code that approved developers have published is deployed in your Lambda functions.

- Lambda extensions

  You can use Lambda extensions to augment your Lambda functions. For example, use extensions to more easily integrate Lambda with your favorite tools for monitoring, observability, security, and governance.

- Function blueprints

  A function blueprint provides sample code that shows how to use Lambda with other AWS services or third-party applications. Blueprints include sample code and function configuration presets for Node.js and Python runtimes.

- Database access

  A database proxy manages a pool of database connections and relays queries from a function. This enables a function to reach high concurrency levels without exhausting database connections.

- File systems access

  You can configure a function to mount an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system to a local directory. With Amazon EFS, your function code can access and modify shared resources safely and at high concurrency.

## Concepts

Lambda runs instances of your function to process events. You can invoke your function directly using the Lambda API, or you can configure an AWS service or resource to invoke your function.

### Function

A function is a resource that you can invoke to run your code in Lambda. A function has code to process the events that you pass into the function or that other AWS services send to the function.

### Trigger

A trigger is a resource or configuration that invokes a Lambda function. Triggers include AWS services that you can configure to invoke a function and event source mappings. An event source mapping is a resource in Lambda that reads items from a stream or queue and invokes a function.

### Event

An event is a JSON-formatted document that contains data for a Lambda function to process. The runtime converts the event to an object and passes it to your function code. When you invoke a function, you determine the structure and contents of the event.
